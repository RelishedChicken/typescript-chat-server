## Typescript Chat Server

This is a companion server to my `typescript-chat` repo which will allow the client(s) to connect to it and send messages. These are stored and can be retrieved by the client.

To run this, clone this repo and run `tsc -b` in the root to build and then `node dist/server.js` to run the built file.

This like the client has no real use case and was purely made to learn Typescript + React with Socket.io.
